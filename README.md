Due to my job, I have switched from .NET to Java.

I think Java is a pretty cool language, but having developed in .NET for quite a white, I find it's standard I/O and 
NIO classes really uncomfortable to use. 

This project aims to wrap an I/O System similar to .NET's around Java's NIO, initended for me and people with a similar opinion.
However, it is in no way complete, but it does what I want. :)
